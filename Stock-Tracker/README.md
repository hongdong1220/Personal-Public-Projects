Stock Tracker
=======

This is a CLI program I wrote to grab some specific data of some stock.

This is intended for checking the average daily intraday move & the overnight move of a Stock
You will enter input as instructed on the program in order for it to work

This program uses the API provided from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)|  [Their PYPI page](https://pypi.org/project/alpha-vantage/)

The code may or may not work as Alpha Vantage changes their API calls
